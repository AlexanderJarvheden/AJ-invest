# AJ-Invest
## Investment application to simplify my strategies
During my summer internship at Atlas Copco, I singlehandedly remade their debugging application from java to a webapp with Python and JS. With the experience acquired, I am starting my first hobby project to combine my programming skills with my interest for finance.

### Goals
I have put my own investment strategies on hold which has been a mistake considering both the inflation loss and the potential investment profits that I have missed out on. Therefore, I want to develop this app to make investment decisions easier and reduce procrastination.
